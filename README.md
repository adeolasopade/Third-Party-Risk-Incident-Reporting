# Third-Party Risk & Incident Reporting

*This project draws on real work, with all company details anonymised.*

---

The work assessed supply-chain risk for a financial software provider, triggered by a ransomware attack originating from a critical payroll and procurement vendor. 

The [documents](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12t3XR1YAt2IN_paceygTidZFhTsYd1Cj?usp=sharing) I created reflect the full incident lifecycle: from analysing the failure of a prior vendor assessment, to reporting the breach, to redesigning a robust vendor risk management framework that prevents recurrence.

## The Approach

*   Analysed the failed 2023 vendor assessment ([Metalytics](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pXpwGxmspPi4iYJ5pR353_V3IhfCOW7A/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=101134501969411208830&rtpof=true&sd=true)), which revealed red flags like an absent CISO and multiple "Partially" or "Not Implemented" controls. This indicated a weak, checkbox-ticking exercise.

*   Prepared the detailed ransomware incident [report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TaRmjdbeS3VrxJQKzW0kDv63rgTJt6-G/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=101134501969411208830&rtpof=true&sd=true), which documented the attack vector, impact, and validated the need for a transformed approach.

*   The 2026 vendor assessment framework ([Motiontek](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10hFIJGcKeZqGyMbSRCsVqaP2IN96ncgs/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=101134501969411208830&rtpof=true&sd=true)) demonstrated a clear evolution to a rigorous, evidence-based methodology. The exhaustive questionnaire mapped controls to specific services (see 'Service Specific Assessment') and demanded concrete evidence.

*   To solidify this shift, the company appointed an external Data Protection Consultancy ([ATSL](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DfzFnfn6JVYE_gHnkSniCR6T_SU9kPjd/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=101134501969411208830&rtpof=true&sd=true)) for independent audits, moving the risk management model from vendor self-assessment to verified, third-party control validation.

## Practical Insights & Recommendations

*   **Lack of Evidence-Based Validation:** The breach was missed because assessments accepted vague promises. *Recommendation*: For critical vendors, mandate proof like encryption screenshots and security logs.

*   **Absence of Continuous Monitoring:** The pre-breach process was a static, annual review. *Recommendation*: Replace this with a dynamic risk register that mandates periodic security scorecards and trigger-based reassessments for real-time risk management.

## Reflection & Learning

Third-party risk is dynamic. A strong initial assessment is insufficient without mechanisms for continuous assurance. 

Future programs should implement right-to-audit clauses with automated evidence collection and require vendor cyber insurance verification as a financial mitigant.
